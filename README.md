# Simple File Renaming Tool
Overview:
Create a simple command-line file renaming tool in Rust that allows users to rename files in bulk using patterns. The tool will accept a directory path, a search pattern, and a replacement pattern as command line arguments. It will then rename all files in the specified directory that match the search pattern according to the replacement pattern.
